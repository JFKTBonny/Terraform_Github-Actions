*** Github Actions is a service provided by Github.com to implement CI/CD from a Github repo without having to install any software or tools...
We only need to write a YAML file and keep it in a folder named ".github/workflows"...
When an event(commit,push,pull request..etc) is triggered, Github would read the YAML file (containing the workflow instructions..) and 
starts executing those actions,without having to install or maintain a full-flegged CI/CD server...
In Github Actions we have jobs and steps...
Each action file must have at least one job...
Each job must have at least one step...
